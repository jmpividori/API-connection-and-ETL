# API-connection-and-ETL

This project is an integral component of an initiative undertaken for a water supply company. The primary objective was to assess the quality of its services and implement improvement measures based on data analysis.

Previous work (step 0):

The preceding phase of the project involved selecting sensors capable of measuring water network pressures. This included choosing optimal placement points, ensuring smooth connectivity between the sensors and the company's private server, and meticulously calibrating the measurements

# Step 1:

After completing the hardware and server setup, I created a script to retrieve data from an API provided by the manufacturer and transformed it to seamlessly integrate into a daily report management system, as detailed in step 2.

The information is extracted and transformed to be used in different parts of the project:

* [Script to retrieve data by sensor](https://github.com/jmpividori/API-connection-and-ETL/blob/main/Request%20by%20sensors.py)
* [ETL-Mergin in one table](https://github.com/jmpividori/API-connection-and-ETL/blob/main/Request%20merging%20all%20data.py)
* [ETL-Categorizing data](https://github.com/jmpividori/API-connection-and-ETL/blob/main/Request%20data%20by%20quality.py)

Outcome:
  
* [Data procesed](https://github.com/jmpividori/API-connection-and-ETL/tree/main/CSV)
